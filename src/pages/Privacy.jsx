                      The App collects and uses the following information for the purpose of connecting the user to

                      for the purpose of connecting the user to Spotify's API and providing access to the App's

                      access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no method of transmission or electronic
                      storage is completely secure, and therefore, the App cannot guarantee the absolute security of the

                      The App may use third-party services, such as Spotify's API, to provide its functionalities. These
                      services have their own privacy policies governing the collection, use, and disclosure of personal
                      information. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party services.
